It has been two months of focused work in my flatiron bootcamp and I think I am finally starting to get it.  The occurence of cold sweats when I start a new lab is subsiding. 
 Today I learned about how to inherit and pass code inheritance and method modules.
 A good example of inheritance that is used in the lab example is 
 a BMW is a car there for if we wanted the attributes of the Car class to be applied to BMW we would write:
 class BMW < Car.
 In contrast we would use the namespace (::) to give BMW access to Car class  methods and constance with out createing a deeper relationship between the two classes. 
 Nesting Modules is a good way to combine and clearly define what modules are intended to do.
```
 module FancyDance
  module InstanceMethods
 
    def twirl
      "I'm twirling!"
    end****
 
    def jump
      "Look how high I'm jumping!"
    end
 
    def pirouette
      "I'm doing a pirouette"
    end
 
    def take_a_bow
      "Thank you, thank you. It was a pleasure to dance for you all."
    end
  end
 
  module ClassMethods
 
    def metadata
      "This class produces objects that love to dance."
    end
  end
end

```

The best part about learning coding with Flatiron is the tech coach support.  I can ask silly or intense questions, questions that would have normally completely stumped me when I was going it alone. The OOP unit is taking longer than i anticipated but it is all worth it because it is starting to make sense.  I have a little parade for myself whenever I see a test pass and green is fast becoming my favorite color.
