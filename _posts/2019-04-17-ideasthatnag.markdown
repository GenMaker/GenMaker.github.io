 “Little ideas that tickle and nag and refuse to go away should never be ignored, for in them lie the seeds of destiny.” – Babe, the movie
 
Did you ever watch a really good movie and one line just hits stright into your core ?  Babe is one of my favorite flicks and this quote about little ideas that tickle describes me , once I get an idea in my head it will not lie quietly. In 2011, I had the pleasure of working in an immersive graduate program that specilized in creating immersive digial experience. Here I watched as programmers created immersive game environments for entertainment, education, and corporate training.   I was already designing environments for theater, film, and museums for over 10 years,  but there were ideas the tickled, nagged, and refused to go away. There was a problem. I couldn't act on any of my ideas. As a traditionally trained artist and designer I was frustratingly unprepared to contribute or create in digital environments. I needed to learn how to talk to a computer. After trying to ignore the urge for a few years, I took it upon myself to learn how to code.   In 2016, after taking a community college class in programming 101, I jumped right into tutoring other adult learners who wanted to learn programming too. While this was rewarding and I learned a ton doing that work, I quickly hit a wall. Community college wasn't going to get me where I wanted to go.  I signed up for Flat Iron March 2019, I am going to finally stop ignoring the nagging idea, begin and Finish this journey to learn how to create with computers.   I'm a pig in a dog's world. Lets do this thing!
