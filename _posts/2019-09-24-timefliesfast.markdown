TimeFliesFast. I just saw a video with Arnold Schwarzenegger talking about motivation and the improtance of having a goal and managing your time well. I feel as motivated as anyone would at hearing these inspiring words but I would be kidding myself if I didn't admit that I feel a bit deflated too. Time is finite but the demands of other parts of a life are seemingly infinate. Everything from laundry to kids to career. Time Flies and as I am working toward my goal of being a sofware engineer. I have to remember that like Arnold says - we have 18 hours a day. Make sure you don't waste one.
